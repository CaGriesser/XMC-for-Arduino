# Overview
This pages summarizes information about the XMC1400 2Go evaluation board and its implementation for the Arduino IDE. The XMC 2Go board consists of a XMC1400 microcontroller with a debugger implemented by a XMC4200 microcontroller. The Infineon homepage of the board can be found soon in [placeholder].

# CAN Terminal Resistor
R3 needs to be removed if the board is neither start nor end node.
